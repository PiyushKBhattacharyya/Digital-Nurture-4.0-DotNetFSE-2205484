## Key Concepts Covered

This course includes structured, hands-on training across the following key areas:

### Design Patterns & Principles
- SOLID principles
- Common patterns like Singleton, Factory, Repository, Dependency Injection

> These principles help write scalable, maintainable, and testable code.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
- Searching and Sorting algorithms
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees
- Time and Space complexity analysis

> Forms the foundation of efficient coding and problem-solving.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- DDL, DML operations (CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Joins, Subqueries, Indexing
- Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views

> Core database skills for managing relational data in enterprise apps.

### NUnit (Unit Testing Framework)
- Writing test cases for C# classes/methods
- Assertions, Setup methods
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

> Ensures software reliability through test-driven development (TDD).

### MOQ (Mocking Framework)
- Mocking dependencies in unit tests
- Isolating logic for behavior testing
- Stubbing method responses

> Used in combination with NUnit to achieve isolated and robust test coverage.

### Entity Framework Core 8.0 (EF Core)
- Code First & Database First approaches
- LINQ queries, migrations, relationships
- CRUD operations with DbContext

> EF Core is an ORM used for data access with .NET applications.

### ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web API
- Building RESTful APIs
- Controllers, Routing, Middleware
- Attribute-based routing, JSON serialization, Swagger

> Enables backend service development for frontend/mobile clients.

### Microservices & JWT Authentication
- Service decomposition into microservices
- Securing APIs using JWT Bearer Tokens
- API Gateway and token validation

> Microservices enable scalable architecture and JWT ensures secure access.

### React.js (Frontend SPA Framework)
- Components, Props, State, Lifecycle
- Event Handling, Forms, Controlled Inputs
- Axios for API calls, React Router

> React builds modern, fast, and dynamic single-page applications.


### Git & Version Control
- Git commands: `clone`, `branch`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- Managing branches and remote repositories (GitHub/GitLab)
- Handling merge conflicts and collaboration workflows

> Version control is essential for team-based, distributed development.
